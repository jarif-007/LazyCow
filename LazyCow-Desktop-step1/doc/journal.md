## 2026-09-30 — docs: sync context.md — Window Layout feature, selection mode, dnd-kit rebuild, single-instance lock
- **Issue:** context.md had drifted from the actual code after the dnd-kit rebuild and Window Layout UI work.
- **Solution:** Rewrote §3–§7 to reflect the current component tree, the shortcut-level windowLayout feature, and Session 5 notes.
- **Files:** doc/context.md; plus (rolled into same commit) src/components/ActionSequence/*, src/components/WindowLayout/*, src/pages/Builder.tsx, electron/main.ts, src/types/actions.ts
- **Verified:** yes (tsc + eslint clean)
- **Commit:** d67bce4
